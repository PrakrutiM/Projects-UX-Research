# Design Projects

## Poirot 
Poirot was built as a browser plugin and mobile app concept to help people be more responsible content consumers. The prototype was designed using Balsamiq, and can be seen in the pdf file. In developing this concept and prototype, I learnt critical skills on user research, usability testing, on accessibility in design principles, on trade offs between nuanced understanding and ease of use and balancing the two, and a lot more. The reading list can be accessed using the Zotero.rdf file in the repository. 

## UX Analysis
As part of our Digital Humanities Design mid-term, I reviewed and analyzed the 1947 Partition Archive, on accessiblity, inclusivity, language representation, data storage and management, web design, mobile-friendliness, and more.

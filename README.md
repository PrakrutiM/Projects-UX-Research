# Design Projects

## Poirot 
Poirot was built as a browser plugin and mobile app concept to help people be more responsible content consumers. The prototype was designed using Balsamiq, and can be seen in the Poirot_PDF.pdf file (I promise I have learnt heaps more about file-naming conventions since then). In developing this concept and prototype, from design brief(an idea) to prototype(concept), I learnt critical skills on user research, usability testing, on accessibility in design principles, on trade offs between nuanced understanding and ease of use and balancing the two, and a lot more. The paper, DesignProject_Poirot.pdf explains this process in greater detail. The reading list can be accessed using the .rdf file in the repository. 

## UX Analysis
As part of our Digital Humanities Design mid-term, I reviewed and analyzed the 1947 Partition Archive, on accessiblity, inclusivity, language representation, data storage and management, web design, mobile-friendliness, and more.
